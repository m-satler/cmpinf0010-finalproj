### Data Sets
[Median Age of Death](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/median-age-death)
- This dataset records the age of death for residents of Pittsburgh from 2011 to 2015. The time of death is based on official records, and the location is based on the primary address of the deceased.

[Firearm Seizures](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pbp-fire-arm-seizures)
- This dataset records the firearm seizures done by the Pittsburgh Police from 2015 to 2022. Seizures may be done if the police suspect involvement in a crime or for the health of the public or for the health of an officer. Exact dates are anonymized for privacy concerns.

### Presentation Keys:

Introduction: Introduce the project, and your approach, talk about the process of how you came up with the metric and some alternatives you may have explored.

The Metric: Describe your metric, and what features are you measuring. What datasets are you using?

The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.

Conclusion: Reflect on how the data-driven determination of “best neighborhood” is the same or different from your personal favorite neighborhood. Each member of the group should write their own response to this.
